For this I created a simple form that allows a user to submit a review for a restaurant. Please build the form to the following specifications:

* The form should have two fieldsets- one for name and email fields, and one for the review fields.
* All form fields should be properly labeled using one of the two methods learned in class.
* The form needs the following fields with the specified name:
    * Full name using the name `name`
    * Email using the HTML5 `email` input type and name `email`
    * Menu selection drop-down using the name `menu` and options with values `steak`, `chicken`, and `vegetarian`
    * Rating radio buttons with name `rating` and values `1` - `5`
    * Checkboxes for the user to indicate if they were greeted upon entering and existing the restaurant. Use name `greeted[]` and values `entered` and `exited`
    * Textarea for comments with  name `comments`

Upon submitting your form, you should be taken to a page where you can see all reviews for the restaurant. Before submitting the assignment, ensure that you see your own submissions in the list.

For city guide,
I created a simple website to act as a guide to your favorite city. Your website should highlight 4-5 of your favorite places in your favorite city. These can include restaurants, parks, museums, activities, or other features you enjoy about the city.

For a facebook clone, I created a "clone" of a facebook profile page. Your objective is to re-create the layout, features, and style of the Facebook profile page as closely as possible. It is acceptable to change some details- like the colors and fonts, but the overall look and feel should be as close to Facebook as possible. You can be creative in who you choose as the subject of your profile page- a historical figure, a celebrity, a pet, etc. This page will be purely static- no need to create clickable drop-downs, pop-ups, etc.

﻿﻿Please complete these specific requirements:

A static (fixed to the top of the window) site header with a logo, search bar, and navigation.
Cover photo, profile photo, and some navigation buttons.
Sidebar on the left with "about me" information, photo thumbnails, and friends thumbnails.
Main content column with a form to add a new post.
At least three posts on the page. At least one post needs to include a photo. All posts need the following:
Post content (text, video, photo)
Like button with some likes
Add comment form
A friendly comment or two
A static sidebar on the right with two ads. (can be ads for anything you like, real or imaginary)
